## Oven dial

### Inconsistent cues


the shape of the dial strongly indicates a point towards the direction the stove is on.  In fact it points in the exact opposite direction as the dial actually indicates.  Small hash mark is diametrically opposite.  

Heuristic evaluation

## Microwave
dial rather than number pad

5 second increments up through 
different increments at different values - at large end of spectrum, goes 1 minute per tick.

pros
takes less space than a dial
can be faster than typing in exact time
exact times are often not known/needed - needs 'about' a minute or two.  quick turn.  immediate feedback.  large turn of wrist = large change in time



## door bell and light
exactly the same button, in extremely close proximity.  At night, the light button glows subtly.  During the day, can't see the light.

## ice cube tray
small - fit into mouths of bottles that american ice cube trays do not

releases *extremely* easily due to the pyramidal shape

# faucets
two variables - pressure and temperature.  Temperature on single rotational axis


# doors
push / pull
instructions on simple mechanisms are symptoms of design failures.  



# metro
 
## folding metro seats
stays out of the way when you don't need them

## alarm bell neutral color in one car, bright red in another





# camera
on/off button right next to shutter.  Makes it extremely easy to accidentally turn off camera rather than take a picture
different button for shooting video than still pictures
