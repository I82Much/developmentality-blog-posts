# Usability and design - lessons from Paris

# Oven dial

## Inconsistent cues
the shape of the dial strongly indicates a point towards the direction the stove is on.  In fact it points in the exact opposite direction as the dial actually indicates.  Small hash mark is diametrically opposite.  

Heuristic evaluation

# Microwave
dial rather than number pad

5 second increments up through 
different increments at different values - at large end of spectrum, goes 1 minute per tick.

# folding metro seats
stays out of the way when you don't need them


# door bell and light
exactly the same button, in extremely close proximity.  At night, the light button glows subtly.  During the day, can't see the light.

# ice cube tray
small - fit into mouths of bottles that american ice cube trays do not

releases *extremely* easily due to the pyramidal shape


# doors
push / pull
instructions on simple mechanisms are symptoms of design failures.
