{\Huge``I started designing apps for my guitar students as a way to compete with Guitar Hero.''}\\

{\Huge``I like to hand someone my phone and say, try this. You'd be amazed at how they struggle to find 
something you thought was obvious.''}\\

{\Huge``If my wife looks at me like I'm nuts (which happens frequently) I try to rethink things.''}\\

{\Huge``Only include features in an app that 80\% of users will use''}\\

{\Huge``If you look at Apple's success I think it's largely the result of keeping things simple and easy to use, and gearing products for the average user. Take the same approach in your apps.''}\\
