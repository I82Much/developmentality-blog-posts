The Best iPhone Guitar Fretboard App: UI Lessons Learned


If you're a guitar player or someone interested in mobile apps and UI design, this post should be of interest to you.

I have been playing guitar for about 3 years but I'm ashamed to admit I haven't mastered the fretboard.  Now that I'm paying for lessons, there's an economic incentive to learn as well - the faster I can locate notes on the fretboard, the less time (read: money) I waste in my lesson.

At one point I toyed with writing an application to help me learn the fretboard, but I thought I'd look and see what was out there first before spending my effort.  I'm glad I did, because there are some excellent offerings.  I found five apps that fit the bill: [Guitar Trainer HDx][], [Electric Guitar Fretboard Addict][], [Fretboard Warrior][], [Fretronome][], and [Fret Tester][]. Here's the bottom line up front:

* Aesthetics matter
* Fat fingers != precise mouse.  Touch targets must be *big*
* What's most convenient for the programmer is not best for the user
* Focus on core features and usability rather than extraneous features
* There is such thing as too much minimalism
* Do not make me accidentally click the 'buy' button.  I can guarantee I will not complete the transaction
* Don't be cheap. $2 can make a big difference.
* Think twice about animation

# Guitar anatomy
For those not familar with the guitar, there are six strings, tuned to different frequencies.  The finger presses down on various frets, shortening the string and producing a different (higher) tone when the string vibrates.  There are typically X frets on a standard guitar, but there is no need to display more than twelve on the screen at any one time - an entire octave fits in 12 frets (12 half steps)

0 1 2  3 4  5 6  7 8 9  10 11 12
E F F# G G# A A# B C C# D  D# E

On my guitar, 12 frets measures approximately X inches long and Y inches wide.  How then do we represent that on a X by Y inch mobile screen?

There are two main approaches - either display the entire fretboard in a zoomed out, small fashion, or provide a zoomed in view of a few frets.  There are pros and cons of each approach.

## Global view (entire fretboard)

Pros

* Better simulates what you see while actually playing guitar
* Provides global picture - easier to see relationship between notes and where frets fall in absolute and relative terms

Cons

* Frets and strings can be very close together and hard to distinguish


## Zoomed in view (partial fretboard)

Pros

* Able to provide much more separation between strings, providing larger touch targets

Cons

* Hard to get a sense of where notes are relative to each other
* Does not simulate reality, unless you play guitar with blinders on with your nose an inch or two from the fretboard






There are three variables at play 

* Fret/string combo
* note name
* note value (on staff)


After the visual display, the second distinguishing mark of the app is how the testing is done.  There are two main ways of testing knowledge - from fret to note, and from note to fret.  When going from fret to note, a given fret is somehow distinguished and the user must indicate the name of the note.  This is unambiguous - there is only one answer (well, two different names for the same notes for accidentals, e.g. F# or Gb both refer to the same note).

On the other hand, we can be asked to go from a note name to a fret/string combination.  This mapping *is* ambiguous - there are multiple Es on the fretboard, for instance.  We need another piece of information in order to pick the correct answer.  For instance, if we are limited to a single string, then our choices drop down to a maximum of two (the open fret and the 12th fret form an octave for instance).  

# Guitar Trainer HDx
[Guitar Trainer HDx][]

Vertically oriented scroll pane

Pros:

* Keeps track of hits, miss, hit %, and total time
* Supports both landscape and portrait views
* Easy to track the portion of the fretboard you've mastered
* Keeps track of some nice stats - Hits, Misses, success rate, total time, time per hit, top score, top level


Cons:
 
* Only see approximately 4 frets at a time, so it's hard to get a big picture view
* Very easy to accidentally hit the "Unlock Guitar" (buy) button at bottom of the screen while choosing one of the note options
* Only tests in one direction - from fret/note combo to note name.

* By default, too much information is presented.  E A D G B E on the strings, numbers on the frets rather than forcing you to see them yourself.  (Necessary given the zoomed in view)


Meh:

* Accidentals are mixed up - e.g. F# will sometimes show up as Gb, sometimes as F#.
* GameCenter integration.  Not really necessary, but you do get achievements from time to time.

Question mark on given fret/string combo, you must select from a variety of possible notes.

## Modes:

* Training mode
* Game

### Game
Gets incrementally harder
Have to identify X notes per level out of Y possible choices

4 selections in a minute with 3 choices for level 1
level 2 4 hits in a minute 

some achievements ("Hit 100 notes")

Can pick multiple tunings, as well as custom tunings

defaults to Show all fret numbers, Show helper notes but you can turn it off in the options
Can also choose the accidentals to be only flats or sharps or both, but again it doesn't show *both* when in both.  Somewhat confusing

Paid options
starting fet, number of frets, number of note choices

Some clever features - vibrating string so while you're scrolled off the screen you can still tell which string you're looking for

Aesthetics - It's OK but nothing to write home about.

Some interesting stats tracked - Hits, Misses, success rate, total time, time per hit, top score, top level


4 stars?

Cons -
it's only one direction, given a note/string combo, name the note.  Never goes the opposite direction, namely given a note, pick the string/fret combo

v3.6x


# Electric Guitar Fretboard Addict v1.4.3
Products by Michael Rylee
[App store][Electric Guitar Fretboard Addict]

Aesthetics - ugly.  Bad clipart, logo looks like it's from a MS word/powerpoint template

Tiny thumbnails advertising his other products - cannot even read them on a retina display

"Each built in Notes exercise contains 133 progressive rounds.  After completing each exercise, you will know the Key and Fretboard by Note, by Position, by String, by Fret, Forwards, Backwards and Randomly."

In app purchases of Chords, Solo etc.  Focusing on notes aspect

Photograph of guitar rather than vector art - no scrolling
Displays 12 frets (full octave) on the screen.  Good global picture
Cons - extremely small touch targets towards the nut.  

Pros:
Displays the actual note on a musical staff, note name
Has you go the opposite direction too


starts off slowly, working just on fret zero.  Work your way up over 133 rounds

No way to jump ahead if you already know some of the fretboard.


No horizontal mode

Free mode lets you play through 28 of 133 exercises for key of C.

3 stars


It's clear that this is a multiplatform game - doesn't fit look and feel of the system at all.

I also tried Guitar Fretboard Addict by the same developer, but as far as I can tell it's identical to the Electric Guitar one with the exception of a different photograph.

# Freboard Warrior
[App store][Fretboard Warrior]

Pick a duration - 1 2 5 10 minutes
Jagged fretboard - not very aesthetically appealing.  Some swirly background.
Horizontal orientation
Large menu takes up space that could be used to either provide bigger touch targets or bigger visualization of the fretboard.  

Jumps all over all 12 frets on all strings.  No way to practice a specific string, section of fretboard

Extremely bare boned.  No frills.  Provides a test of your skills in one direction (fret/string -> note).

3 stars





# Fretronome
[App store link][Fretronome]
Horizontal
Vector graphic rather than photo - no perspective distortion
Can focus on one string at a time, or do all for variety

Extremely large touch target - up to you to keep track of if you get it right or not.  Kind of like flashcards

Result -> What the note was
Large dot, easy to tell which fret is indicated

Also does interval training
Extremely attractive aesthetics - nice fade to black near edges of fretboard
Notes reference - wtf ?  B is erroneously indicated as H.  Off by one error? But you don't need to use it.

No countdown / ticking clock to distract you

Perhaps only thing that would be better is if it gave you a Yes / No button to let it automatically track your accuracy.

4 or 4.5 stars

still only goes one direction


# Fret Tester
$1.99 [App store link][Fret Tester]

I decided to try a paid app to see if it would fare any better than these free ones.  I'm glad I did - I use it exclusively now.

This app gives a horizontal view of the fretboard, defaulting to a zoomed in view of 6 of the frets, but optionally zooming out to show 12.  Unlike Guitar Trainer HDx, the fret board does not scroll in the zoomed in view; rather only the region of interest is displayed.  Like Fretronome, the fretboard is rendered as an idealized graphical form rather than as a photograph.  This ensures that there is no distortion of the fretboard.  The aesthetics are excellent.

There are four modes - Name Note, Find Note, Notation, and Notes on Staff.  

Name Note is the standard mode which all of these apps provide.  In this mode, dots appear on the strings and you must name the note, choosing from among the options at the bottom of the screen.  The names of the 7 notes are displayed as large touch targets on the bottom of the screen (A, B, C, D, E, F, G).  The accidentals (sharps and flats) are hidden and only revealed when the sharp key is pressed.  When in that mode, the A turns to A#, C to C#, and so on and so forth.

This is a great design choice for two reasons.  First, natural notes are more common (7 out of 12 possible notes), so it makes sense to optimize for finding them quickly.  Second, by restricting the choices to 7 as opposed to 12 as many of the other apps do, the touch targets can be much bigger with more separation between them.  This makes a huge difference in the usability of the app, as you will rarely if ever click the wrong button on accident.

When you misidentify a note twice in a row, the correct answer will be highlighted green, but you must still make the correct choice before the next note is displayed.  This is a good pedagogical trick, as you must always get the right answer to move on, even if the app helps.  In contrast, Guitar Trainer HDx immediately flags your answer as "WRONG!" and moves you to the next note automatically.

Unlike the other apps, there is no timed mode.  I don't mind this as I find a ticking clock stressful and distracting.  It does give you a measure of your speed by displaying a 'beats per minute' value (the rate at which you are identifying notes/frets), as well as a graphical representation (turtle, hare, car, rocket ship).  I like the simplicity of the icons and prefer this way of measuring speed to a time trial.

Playing with this app provides a much more fluid experience and helps me enter the [flow][] state much more than the others.  I struggled to determine why that was until I noticed two main differences.  

The first is that there is no extraneous animation between the identification of one note and the display of the next.  For instance, Guitar Trainer HDx hides all the other answers after you've made the correct choice, and displays a huge CORRECT! on the screen which rotates around and leaves the screen.  I'm all for positive reinforcement but I don't need that much, and I don't need the second or two pause between the identification of one note and the display of the next.  This app moves on to the next note with no hesitation, allowing you to drill yourself as fast as you can think.

The second difference is more technical.  If 


Strange UI thing - hits are registered on *press* rather than *release*, meaning it's impossible for you to correct yourself if you realize you're about to make a mistake by moving your fingers off the fret.  It's a minor annoyance, and has the positive side effect of seemingly increasing the responsiveness (when you're right, you're on to the next note in a flash)




Recall that only Electric Guitar Fretboard Addict had some of these additional features.


You can track your progress by means of a graphical representation of your mastery of each fret.

One minor complaint about this display is that there is no real meaning to the order of the color.  As Edward Tufte, a noted interaction designer writes, 
...
In my opinion, this should have been  a linear interpolation between two colors (white to black).  This would allow one to get a better sense of overall progress without continually having to refer to the color chart.

Just like Fretronome, you can restrict the strings that are quizzed.  Furthermore, you can restrict the range of frets (from first to third, for instance), as well as toggling accidentals.  This allows you to focus on one specific problem area.

Supports bass, mandolin, 5 string base, left handed mode, alternate tunings

Find note - 
zoomed in, extremely generous touch markers
zoomed out, still able to hit the notes accurately - because it restricts to a single string, you do not need to worry about the tiny spacing between strings
