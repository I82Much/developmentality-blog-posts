[Beautiful LEGO][], by Mike Doyle, asks the question "Can LEGO be art?" Given that Mr. Doyle is himself a LEGO artist, it's no surprise that the answer presented in the work is a resounding yes. If you're looking for an in-depth discussion of the subject with academic criticism, look somewhere else. If you're already a fan, this book is an incredible collection of artistic talent, and one I recommend without reservation.

# Contents
The book is divided into various themed sections, punctuated by interviews with some of the artists. Usually these interviews try to get at how the artists got into the medium, or what they find compelling about it. My favorite quote is from Lino Martins:

![Lino Martins' "Hidden Treasure - 1949 Buick Fastback"](http://www.inmygarage.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/brickwork_lego-cars_lino-martins_07.jpg)

>One LEGO piece, while an engineering marvel, is not very exciting on its own, but bins of thousands of pieces - that's stored kinetic potential. That is a million works of art waiting to be made. That is life. And in the hands of another LEGO artist, the very same pieces can become a million things I have never fathomed myself. It's like being in art school all over again. Even without a signature, our styles are diverse enough that we can tell one artist's work from another. (p. 186)

# Styles
I thought this comment on styles was hyperbole, but as I looked through the book a few times, I realized that it's not. I started to recognize artists that appeared in multiple sections of the book. For instance, [Tyler Clites][] packs a ton of personality into small spaces. ["Sometimes It Sucks To Be a Ghost"][] (p. 105), shows a ghost being sucked into a vacuum cleaner, with toys strewn about the floor. Without reading the artist's name, I guessed that another work, ["Grandpa! You better not be using my loofah again!"][]  (p.92) was by the same author.

The styles and scale of composition vary tremendously among the artists. Mike Doyle, for instance, creates enormous, intricate, realistic [decaying Old Victorian mansions][]
![Mike Doyle's "Three Story Victorian with Tree"][]

Nathan Sawaya creates life size human sculptures, such as [Frozen Figure][] (p. 48). Others create whimsical fantasy architecture on a medium scale, such a Sean and Steph Mayo's [Micro Fall's Fortress][] (p. 142). MisaQa's [Little Town][] (p. 106-107) is even more microscopic.

At the most minimal level are Eric Constantino's adorable [Big Eyed LEGO Duck][] and [Big Eyed LEGO Peacock][], which are instantly recognizable yet weigh in at no more than a dozen pieces or so.

This book helped me appreciate the fact that there is real artistry and talent that goes into making very small scenes. It's easy to appreciate the enormous scale of Nathan Sawaya and Mike Doyle's work, but I am convinced that just as much skill goes into some of the smaller compositions featured in this book.

# Conclusion
The production quality of this book is excellent. All of the pictures have had their backgrounds digitally erased and replaced with a pleasing gradient texture (look at the Mike Doyle pictures I linked to above to get a sense of what all the pictures look like). There are a few places where the photos submitted by the artist were clearly not high resolution enough to feature in the book, and they look very out of place. The two instances I found were "Mort" (p. 101) and "Pierre, Of Course" (p. 133). This is a minor nitpick of an otherwise excellent book. For some sample high-res images see [MicroBots][], or the page of [horses][].

I have read through this book about four times now, twice on my own, and twice with a 2- and 3-year-old on my lap. They would not let me put it down and were awe-struck on every page, oohing and awwing. As soon as I finished it once, they made me immediately start over again. It was wonderful to see such excitement and energy channeled towards these LEGO creations. 

This book is a wonderful addition to my library, and I'm confident that anyone with a passing appreciation for LEGO will love it too.
