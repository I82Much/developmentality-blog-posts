Don't repeat yourself. DRY. I've had this principle hammered into my head by so many books and speakers, and it is absolutely true.

You cannot expect people to follow directions in comments.  e.g. "This enum must be kept in sync with another one in another filed"
People don't read. People are fallible. If duplication is impossible to avoid, you *must* put in place automated tests to catch these problems.

e.g. keeping two lists in synch, have an automated test which pulls in each list and ensures that they're exactly the same
