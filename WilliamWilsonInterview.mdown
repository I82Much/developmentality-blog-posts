<p>I recently had the opportunity to speak with William Wilson, the man behind <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fret-tester-learn-notes-for/id442144977?mt=8">Fret Tester</a>, the best guitar fretboard learning application available for iOS, and one of the nicest designed apps I&#8217;ve used.  I wrote about its great UI features in my previous post, <a href="http://developmentality.wordpress.com/2012/02/16/the-best-iphone-guitar-fretboard-app-usability-lessons-learned/">The Best iPhone Guitar Fretboard App: Usability Lessons Learned</a>.  I wanted to pick the designer&#8217;s brain to see what lessons he could impart about designing usable applications.  Here&#8217;s what he had to say.</p>

<p><b><em>
Please tell me a little about your background.  Do you design mobile applications for a living or as a hobby?
</em></b></p>

<p>I&#8217;m actually a professional guitarist. I make my living teaching and performing classical and Spanish guitar in San Diego.  I&#8217;ve always loved programming, starting with Basic, then HyperCard, Java, Flash, and eventually C. I started designing apps for my guitar students as a way to compete with Guitar Hero. I got tired of hearing: &#8220;Sorry Mr. Wilson, I didn&#8217;t practice, but I played Guitar Hero, does that count?&#8221; My first attempts were in Java, and were really awful. I&#8217;ve since done about 15 flash games (on my site <a href="http://guitargames.net">guitargames.net</a>) and 4 iOS apps. I&#8217;ve mostly learned from books and online tutorials. Right now it&#8217;s a hobby, but I&#8217;d love to do more of it.</p>

<p><b><em>
As a musician first and foremost, what were the deficiencies you saw in the other published guitar apps and how did you aim to address them?</em></b></p>

<p>Traditionally when learning the neck students start with the natural (not sharp and flat) notes. That way they establish landmarks on the neck. I didn&#8217;t see this feature being a big part of any app. For me having the iPhone version just display the natural notes made sense (with a button to shift into sharps). Plus it&#8217;s tough to fit 12 buttons on the screen without clutter.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges I saw was how to zoom in on the neck. With many of the apps, I tried I lost a sense of where I was on the neck. But if the whole neck was shown it was too small. I decided to have my app zoom to the area that was being tested, but to allow sufficient area on either side so the user had a sense for where they were. Plus I included the option to zoom all the way out should the user prefer it. Related to this, I thought many of the apps lacked reinforcement. When you pushed the correct answer your finger covered it. I added the key style buttons so users could see what note the pushed and thus reinforce the correct answer.</p>

<p><b><em>
How have your students received your work? Have you seen a measurable improvement in their progress?
</em></b></p>

<p>I wish I could say that the app was a runaway success with my students&#8230; Unfortunately there is a mindset out there that you aren&#8217;t practicing unless you have a guitar in your hand. Mental practice is too often neglected, both with note naming and music theory. For the students who have taken my advice and used the app I&#8217;ve seen good things. I think separating the mental and physical complexities of the guitar is the way to go.</p></p>

<p><b><em>
What advice would you offer to other people who are not programmers by trade but have an idea for a program or application that could simplify or improve some aspect of their everyday life?  What resources have you found that were useful in turning your dream into reality?
</em></b></p>

<p>There are tons of great resources out there. I always recommend <a href="http://masters-of-the-void.com/">http://masters-of-the-void.com/</a> as a first step. Also Steven Kochan&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Objective-C-Edition-Developers-Library/dp/0321811909/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331432528&amp;sr=1-1">Programming in Objective C</a> is great for learning to write for iOS.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-g0N26MQa_g4/T1182pFcO8I/AAAAAAAABNo/p2OioBT-G6E/s576/Picture+164.png" alt="Obvious pullquote" /> </p>

<p>Outside &#8220;traditional&#8221; programming there were three books that greatly influenced me. One is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-The-Edition/dp/0321534042/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331432839&amp;sr=1-1">The Non-Designer&#8217;s Design Book</a> by Robin Williams, it will help you design a decent looking app. Second is Dave Woolridge&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Business-iPhone-App-Development/dp/1430227338/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331432367&amp;sr=8-2">Business of iPhone App Development</a>, make sure you can sell one or two before you spend a year creating an app. And finally <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331432204&amp;sr=8-1">Don&#8217;t Make Me Think</a> by Steve Krug, a guide for good UI principles.</p>

<p>Also I would say make sure to beta test often. I had about 8 people test Fret Tester and learned something from everyone. I like to hand someone my phone and say, try this. You&#8217;d be amazed at how they struggle to find something you thought was obvious.</p>

<p><b><em>
You mentioned making sure that you can sell a product before you invest too much time in producing it.  How do you recommend that app developers do this?  Do you create a bare bones v 0.0 prototype and put it on the app store to gauge interest?  Or do you have an alternative technique for market research?
</em></b></p>

<p>First I look around and see if there are similar apps already out there. If there are a ton, and they&#8217;re good, I move on. If there are none I also move on, since there probably isn&#8217;t a market for what I&#8217;m designing, I want to at least see things that are similar. My goal is to design an app that reaches an already existing need. Not that I&#8217;m always successful in it. After reading Woolridge&#8217;s book, as well as listening to Seth Godin&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Purple-Cow-New-Edition-Remarkable--Includes/dp/1591843170/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331432446&amp;sr=1-2">Purple Cow</a> (Audio Book) I&#8217;ve improved in this area. I also just talk to people about my idea. If my wife looks at me like I&#8217;m nuts (which happens frequently) I try to rethink things.</p>

<p><b><em>
Are you working on any new projects currently?  Or do you have ideas for the next thing you want to work on?</p>
</em></b></p>

<p>Yes, I&#8217;ve been playing around with Adobe&#8217;s new <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/stage3d.html">Stage 3D</a> and the <a href="http://gamua.com/starling/">Starling Framework</a>. It seems promising. I&#8217;m hoping to release my first game using it soon. It is called Tab Warrior and is kind of a cross between Fret Tester and Space Invaders. Also, I&#8217;m going to try my hand at an Android app this year.</p>

<p><b><em>
Great to hear. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Do you have any parting thoughts for the readers?
</em></b></p>

<p>One thing I read in Apple&#8217;s docs was to only include features in an app that 80% of users will use. That totally changed my approach. If you look at Apple&#8217;s success I think its largely the result of keeping things simple and easy to use, and gearing products for the average user. Take the same approach in your apps.</p>
